Do you like playing card games?

In this challenge, you have to calculate the value of a hand of cards. Write a function to do it. Your input is an string representing your cards (every card is represented by a value and a suit), and your output must be the total value of the set.
</p>
<p>
The suits are:
</p>
<p>
    C: Clubs<br>
    D: Diamonds<br>
    H: Hearts<br>
    S: Spades<br>
</p>
<p>
Card values are between 2 and 10. Figure values are:
</p>
<p>
A = 11<br>
J, Q, K = 10
</p>
<p>
If only two suits are in the hand, add 10 points. If all cards are of the same suit, add 25 points. 
</p>

<p>
You must develop a function to calculate the value of a hand of cards
<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> One argument, a list of string. Each string in the list starts
    with a letter corresponding to a suit, and a number from 2 to 10 or a letter corresponding
    to a figure.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> Int. The total value of the hand.

        <strong>Example:</strong>
    </p>
    <pre class="brush: python">
hand(['2C', '10H', 'AD', 'KH', '4S']) == 37
hand(['9H', 'QD', 'QC', '3H', '3D', 'AC', 'AH']) == 57
    </pre>
